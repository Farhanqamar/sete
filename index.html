    <P>The Battle of Badr (Arabic: غَزْوَةُ بَدْرٍ Arabic pronunciation: [ɣazwatu badr]),
        also referred to as The Day of the Criterion (Arabic: يَوْمُ الْفُرْقَانْ, Arabic pronunciation:
        [jawm'ul fur'qaːn]) in the Qur'an and by Muslims, took place on March 15, 624 CE
        (Ramadan 19, 2 AH),[3] near the present-day city of Badr, Al Madinah Province in Saudi Arabia.
        Muhammad, commanding an army of his Sahaba, defeated an army of the Quraysh led by Amr
        ibn Hishām, better known among Muslims as Abu Jahl. The battle marked the beginning of the
        six-year war between Muhammad and his tribe. Before the battle, the Muslims and the Meccans had fought
        several smaller skirmishes in late 623 and early 624.</P>

    <p>At the beginning of his prophetic mission in his hometown, Mecca, Muhammad did not encounter
        serious opposition until he attacked the beliefs of the local Quraysh.[4][5] As the
        relationship with the Meccans grew increasingly worse, Muhammad brought his followers to
        emigrate (Hijrah) to Medina after successful negotiations with Banu Aws and Khazraj to mediate
        their tribal conflicts.[9][19] In Medina, Muhammad received a divine revelation that authorized
        the Muslims to launch attacks on the polytheists without being attacked first, and he targeted
        the Meccan trade caravans for plunder.[9] Muslim historians give no particular motive for these
        attacks. According to Peters, F. E., these raids were probably Muhammad's immediate response

        to his people's poverty in the new territory because they lacked agricultural knowledge and money
        for commerce.[11]</p>
